## Summary

-   Why make a package?
-   Where packages come from and where do they live?
-   Package States
-   How to make a minimal documented package and check it using the `devtools`[@wickham2021] approach
-   Components of a minimal package

::: aside
Based on [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) [@wickham2020], Data Science for Modern and Open Research: You can make an R package too! [@rand2021], [Forwards Package development modules](https://github.com/forwards/workshops) [@rand]
:::

## Prerequisites

You should have

-   R and RStudio
-   R build toolchain: Rtools(windows) or XCode (mac) or r-base-dev
-   `devtools` and `assertthat`
-   optionally git, a GitHub account and verified it can talk to RStudio

## Learning Objectives {.smaller}

by the end of this session you will able to:

-   explain the rationale for writing packages
-   describe the different states a package can be in
-   create a minimal package and explain its key components
-   add functions with `usethis:use_r()`
-   use the package interactively with `devtools::load_all()`
-   use `devtools::check()` to execute `R CMD` check
-   add a license with `usethis::use_mit_license()`
-   add documentation using **`roxygen2`** and `devtools::document()`
-   add package dependencies with `usethis::use_package()`

# Why make a package?

## Why make a package?

Conventionally:

-   Package developers
-   Generalisable analytical methods
-   For use on other data
-   Public release

## Why make a package?

Package up your data analysis project!

-   You don't need to have a collection of highly generalisation functions
-   You don't need to share it with anyone else
-   If you are already trying to work reproducibly you are almost doing it anyway!
-   But it will help you do it better

## Why make a package?

If you are already trying to work reproducibly you are almost doing it anyway!

    /stem-cell-proteomic
       /data-raw
       /data-processed
       /figures
       /R
       README.md
       report.Rmd
       stem-cell-proteomic.RProj

... making a package is just a short step beyond that

## Script vs package

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
### Script

-   one-off data analysis
-   defined by `.R` extension
-   `library()` calls
-   documentation in \# comments
-   `source()`
:::

::: {.column width="65%"}
### Package

-   defines reusable components
-   defined by presence of `DESCRIPTION` file
-   Required packages specified in `DESCRIPTION`, made available in `NAMESPACE` file
-   documentation in files and `Roxygen` comments
-   Install and restart

# Where packages come from and live?

## Where do R packages come from?

CRAN:

```{r}
install.packages("praise")
```

GitHub:

```{r}
remotes::install_github("rladies/praise")
```

Bioconductor

```{r}
BiocManager::install("celaref")
```

## Where do packages live?

In a library! In

```{r}
#| eval: true
R.home()
```

The R home directory is the top-level directory of your R installation.

Note: this is **not** the same as your working directory or your home directory.

## Your R installation

```{r}
#| eval: true
list.files(R.home())
```

## Your library

```{r}
#| eval: true
.Library
```

## Your library

```{r}
#| eval: true
dir(.Library)
```

# Package states

## Package states

There are five states a package can be in:

-   source

-   bundled

-   binary

-   installed

-   in-memory

::: aside
Having a understanding of the different states a package can be helpful in understanding package development.

If a package is installed, `library()` makes its function available by loading the package into memory and attaching it to the search path.

We do not use `library()` for packages we are working on

`devtools::load_all()` loads a source package directly into memory.

# Create a package!

## Create a package

Be deliberate about where you create your package

Do not nest inside another RStudio project, R package or git repo.

ðŸŽ¬ Create a package:

```{r}
usethis::create_package("~/Desktop/mypackage")
```

::: aside
You may want a different path
:::

##  {.smaller}

```{r}
âˆš Creating 'C:/Users/er13/Desktop/mypackage/'
âˆš Setting active project to 'C:/Users/er13/Desktop/mypackage'
âˆš Creating 'R/'
âˆš Writing 'DESCRIPTION'
Package: mypackage
Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors\@R (parsed):
   * First Last \<first.last\@example.com\> \[aut, cre\] (YOUR-ORCID-ID)
Description: What the package does (one paragraph).
License: \`use_mit_license()\`, \`use_gpl3_license()\` or friends to
    pick a license
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)
RoxygenNote: 7.1.1
âˆš Writing 'NAMESPACE'
âˆš Writing 'mypackage.Rproj'
âˆš Adding '.Rproj.user' to '.gitignore'
âˆš Adding '\^mypackage\\\\.Rproj\$', '\^\\\\.Rproj\\\\.user\$' to '.Rbuildignore'
âˆš Opening 'C:/Users/er13/Desktop/mypackage/' in new RStudio session
âˆš Setting active project to '\<no active project\>'
```

## `create_package()`

What happens when we run `create_package()`?

-   R will create a folder called `mypackage` which is a package and an RStudio project

-   restart R in the new project

-   create some infrastructure for your package

-   start the RStudio Build pane

::: aside
continued.....
:::

## `create_package()`

What happens when we run `create_package()`?

-   `mypackage.Rproj` is the file that makes this directory an RStudio Project.

-   `DESCRIPTION` provides metadata about your package.

-   The `R/` directory is where we will put `.R` files with function definitions.

-   `NAMESPACE` declares the functions your package exports for external use and the external functions your package imports from other packages.

::: aside
continued.....
:::

## `create_package()`

What happens when we run `create_package()`?

-   `.Rbuildignore` lists files that we need but that should not be included when building the R package from source.

-   `.gitignore` anticipates Git usage and ignores some standard, behind-the-scenes files created by R and RStudio.

## Add a function

Functions will go in an `.R` file.

There's a `usethis` helper for adding `.R` files!

```{r}
usethis::use_r("file_name")
```

`usethis::use_r()` adds the file extension and saves in `R/` folder

## `usethis::use_r()`

ðŸŽ¬ Create a new R file in your package called `animal_sounds.R`

. . .

```{r}
usethis::use_r("animal_sounds")
```

. . .

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|3"
âˆš Setting active project to 'C:/Users/er13/Desktop/mypackage'
â€¢ Modify 'R/animal_sounds.R'
â€¢ Call \`use_test()\` to create a matching test file
```

## Add the function

ðŸŽ¬ Put the following code into your script:

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|2-4"
animal_sounds <- function(animal, sound) {
  assertthat::assert_that(
    assertthat::is.string(animal),
    assertthat::is.string(sound)
  )
  paste0("The ", animal, " goes ", sound, "!")
}
```

# Test your function

## Development workflow

In a normal script you might use:

```{r}
source("R/animal_sounds.R")
```

. . .

but when building packages we use a `devtools` approach

## Development workflow

![Development workflow](images/dev_cycle_before_testing.png){fig-alt="there are three boxes with arrow joining them clockwise. The boxes are (clockwise from 3' oclock) 'devtools::load_all() Cmd/Ctrl + Shift +L', 'Explore in console' and 'Modify code'"}

# Load your package

## `devtools::load_all()`

ðŸŽ¬ Load package with `devtools::load_all()`.

```{r}
devtools::load_all()
```

    Loading mypackage

## Test

Test the `animal_sounds()` function in the console.

```{r}
animal_sounds("dog", "woof")
```

    [1] "The dog goes woof!"

## `devtools::load_all()`

ðŸŽ¬ Change some tiny thing about your function - maybe the animal "says" instead of "goes"?

. . .

ðŸŽ¬ Load with `devtools::load_all()` and test the updated function.

# Check your package

## Check your package

`R CMD check` is the gold standard for checking that an R package is in full working order.

It is a programme that is executed in the shell.

However, `devtools` has the `check()` function to allow you to run this without leaving your R session.

## `devtools::check()`

ðŸŽ¬ Check your package

```{r}
devtools::check()
```

## `devtools::check()`

You will get lots of output ending with:

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|4-7|9-10"
-- R CMD check results -------------------- mypackage 0.0.0.9000 ----
  Duration: 12.5s

> checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... WARNING
  Non-standard license specification:
    `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to pick a license
  Standardizable: FALSE

> checking dependencies in R code ... WARNING
  '::' or ':::' import not declared from: 'assertthat'
0 errors âˆš | 2 warnings x | 0 notes âˆš
```

## Aside: in case of error

On running `devtools::check()` you may get an error if you are using a networked drive.

    Updating mypackage documentation  
    Error: The specified file is not readable: path-to\mypackage\NAMESPACE

This is covered [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40530968/overwriting-namespace-and-rd-with-roxygen2) and can be fixed.

## Aside: in case of error

Save a copy of this file:

[fix_for_networked_drives.R](https://forwards.github.io/workshops/package-dev-modules/slides/03-your-first-package/fix_for_networked_drives.R)

Save it somewhere other than the `mypackage` directory

Open the file from the `mypackage` project session

Run the whole file

You should now find that `devtools::check()` proceeds normally

# License

## Add a license

`usethis` helps out again! `use_mit_license()`, `use_agpl_license()`, `use_ccby_license()` etc

ðŸŽ¬ Add a MIT license[^1] - use your own name!

[^1]: MIT: Simple and permissive license that lets people use and freely distribute your code

```{r}
usethis::use_mit_license("Emma Rand") 
```

. . .

ðŸŽ¬ What files have appeared?

ðŸŽ¬ How has the `DESCRIPTION` file changed?

ðŸŽ¬ Run `devtools::check()` again. Has one of the warnings disappeared?

# Document your package

## Levels of package documentation

-   Metadata: The `DESCRIPTION` file -- an overview of "what's in this package?"

-   Object documentation: Documentation for each of the exported functions and datasets in the package, along with examples of usage

-   Vignettes: Long form documentation, generally discussing how to use a number of functions from the - package together and/or how a package fits into a larger ecosystem of packages

-   pkgdown sites: Websites for your package!

## Metadata in `DESCRIPTION` {.smaller}

-   Title: One line, title case, with no period. Fewer than 65 characters.

-   Version

    -   for release: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version.
    -   for development version building on version MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, use: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.9000

-   Authors\@R: "aut" means author, "cre" means creator, "ctb" means contributor.

-   Description: One paragraph describing what the package does. Keep the width of the paragraph to 80 characters; indent subsequent lines with 4 spaces.

-   License

-   Encoding: How to encode text, use UTF-8 encoding.

-   LazyData: Use true to lazy-load data sets in the package.

## Update `DESCRIPTION`

ðŸŽ¬ Add a title and description.

ðŸŽ¬ Add yourself as an author and creator.

## Object documentation

Object documentation is what you see when you use `?` or `help()` to find out more about a function or a dataset in a package.

We will create object documentation using Roxygen comments, which start with #'

Much of the work is done by the `roxygen2` package, but we won't directly run `roxygen2` functions, instead run functions from devtools that call them

## Object documentation workflow

-   Add roxygen comments to your .R files.

-   Run `devtools::document()` to convert roxygen comments to .Rd files.

-   Load the current version of the package with `devtools::load_all()`

-   Preview documentation with `?`

-   Rinse and repeat until the documentation looks the way you want.

## Document your function

ðŸŽ¬ Open animal_sounds.R

ðŸŽ¬ Go to Code \> Insert Roxygen Documentation

ðŸŽ¬ Fill in the documentation: Give your function a title, then, in a new paragraph, a brief description, define the two parameters, and finally, describe what the function returns

ðŸŽ¬ Save `animal_sounds.R`, run `devtools::document()` followed by `devtools::load_all()`

ðŸŽ¬ Preview the documentation with `?animal_sounds` and edit your documentation if anything needs to be changed

## Add examples

ðŸŽ¬ Under `@examples`, add one example for using your function

ðŸŽ¬ Save `animal_sounds.R`, run `devtools::document()` followed by `devtools::load_all()`

ðŸŽ¬ Preview the documentation with `?animal_sounds` and edit your documentation if anything needs to be changed

# Package dependencies

## Remember this?

```{r}
-- R CMD check results -------------------- mypackage 0.0.0.9000 ----
  Duration: 12.5s

> checking dependencies in R code ... WARNING
  '::' or ':::' import not declared from: 'assertthat'
0 errors âˆš | 1 warnings x | 0 notes âˆš
```

. . .

-   We have used a function from the `assertthat` package in a function in our package

-   But we haven't declared that officially, we need to do that

## Package dependencies

-   **Imports**: Packages listed here must be installed for your package to work. If they're not, they will get installed along with the package you're installing.
-   **Suggests**: Packages listed here are used by your package, but not required for your package. You might use suggested packages for example datasets, to run tests, build vignettes, or maybe there's only one function that needs the package.
-   **Depends**: Avoid where possible, but you might use it to require a specific version of R, e.g. Depends: R (\>= 3.4.0). Think critically before doing this as it will have downstream effects on other packages that depend on your package.

## Package Imports

`usethis::use_package()` is there for us again! It defaults to imports[^2]

[^2]: Use the `type` aregument to add as a Suggest: `usethis::use_package("assertthat",type = "Suggests")`

ðŸŽ¬ Use `usethis::use_package()` to add the `assertthat` package to `Imports`

. . .

```{r}
usethis::use_package("assertthat") # Defaults to imports
#> âœ“ Adding 'assertthat' to Imports field in DESCRIPTION
#> â€¢ Refer to functions with `assertthat::fun()`
```

## Package Imports

ðŸŽ¬ How your `DESCRIPTION` file changed?

ðŸŽ¬ Run `devtools::check()` again. Has the warning disappeared?

# ðŸ“¦ Woo hooðŸ“¦ <BR> You made a package!
