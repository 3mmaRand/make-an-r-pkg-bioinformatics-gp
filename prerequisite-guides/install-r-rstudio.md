# Install R and RStudio

You will need: - R 4.x. Version 3.6.x will likely be fine but I recommend that you install the latest versions if possible - RStudio 1.2 or above

## Installing R

Download the pre-compiled binary for your OS from https://cloud.r-project.org/ and install. More specifically, for version number #.#.# (e.g. 4.0.0):

### For Windows

Click "Download R for Windows", then "base", then "Download R #.#.# for Windows". This will download an `.exe` file; once downloaded, open to start the installation. If you do not have administrator rights, the installer will default to install in your Documents folder - if you prefer, you can change the location to another folder that you have write access to.

### For Mac

Click "Download R for (Mac) OS X", then "R-#.#.#.pkg" to download the installer. Run the installer to complete installation.

### For Linux

Click "Download R for Linux". Instructions on installing are given for Debian, Redhat, Suse and Ubuntu distributions. Where there is a choice, install both `r-base` and `r-base-dev`.

## Installing R Studio

Downloads are available from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ (scroll to the end of the page to see the downloads). You want RStudio Desktop (Open Source License).

### For Windows with no admin rights

Download the `.zip` source archive under "Zip/Tarballs". Extract the files to a folder where you have write access, e.g. `C:\Users\username\RStudio`. In this folder, open the `bin` directory and find the RStudio program: it is named `rstudio.exe`, but the file extension will typically be hidden, so look for `rstudio`. Right-click this executable to create a desktop shortcut. Double-click the executable or use the shortcut to open.

### For all other operating systems

Download the relevant installer for your OS listed under "Installers for Supported Platforms". Run the installer to complete installation.
